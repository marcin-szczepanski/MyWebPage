I am a fifth-year student of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan.
<br /> <br />
In February 2019 I finished engineering studies in computer science with a specialization _"Information and Internet technologies"_, defending my thesis _"StudyCave e-learning platform. Analysis of specific tools supporting learning."_.
<br />
I am currently preparing a master's thesis entitled _"Building Intelligent Tutoring Systems for students of computer science implementing different learning strategies"_.
<br /> <br />
In 2020 I will be recruiting for the Doctoral School AMU.
<br />
I am interested in e-learning, didactics and logic - in particular fuzzy logic.
<br />
I work in technologies such as Angular, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python.
<br />
I am learning English, which I currently speak at B2 level, and German from scratch.
